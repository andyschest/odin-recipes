        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Apricot Kolaches originally hail from Eastern Europe. This style is a popular in Hungary, and has become a Christmas tradition in many regions of the United States.</p>

        <p>Other versions of Kolaches can be traced to Chzech and Polish heritages (among others), and can take a variety of shapes and fillings.</p>

        <p>While the Hungarian Kolache is commonly called a cookie, it is actually closer to a pastry, as are all Kolaches. This version, in particular, is famous for its cream cheese douugh, which gives it a rich, suprisingly deep flavor profile.</p>

                    <li>Remove from stove, let cool for a bit, then puree filling in a food processor. If the filling is too thin, return it to the saucepan and continue to cook until thickened.</li>

                    <li>Remove from mixer and divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Flatten each to 3/4" thick and wrap in plastic wrap, then refrigerate until hard, at least 2 hours.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>With a pastry or pizza wheel, trim the dough into 2" or 2 and 1/2" squares.</li>
                    <li>Place a 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of filling into the center o each square. Gently fold opposite corners, one over the other, and pich together.</li>
